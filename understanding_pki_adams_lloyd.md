## Motivations for PKI
- PKI can be used as the underlying technology to support authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation.
  - Non-repudiation - Assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identify, so neither can later deny having processed the information.
- How can PKI give a positive return on investment? Judicious deployment of a single, unifying PKI technology can help, among other things:
  - Reduce administrative overhead
  - Reduce the number of passwords required by end users
  - Reduce paperwork and improve workflow efficiencies through more automation
  - Optimize work-force productivity by minimizing the amount of time required to spend on security infrastructure
